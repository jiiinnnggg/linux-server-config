# linux-server-config

The goal of this project is to ultimately deploy the Item Catalog application developed earlier in the FSND course to a linux server. We'll confiugre a ubuntu OS-only instance on AWS (Amazon Lightsail), install and update required packages, set up SSH key login for a new user, configure an Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), configure a PostgresQL database server, configure Apache/WSGI to serve the Flask application, and modify the application's OAuth for user logins.

The deployed application is available (until about early Sep 2018) at: [http://35.174.159.105.xip.io/]
